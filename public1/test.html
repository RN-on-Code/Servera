  <h1>Test Firebase Realtime Database</h1>
  <p><b>Subject:</b> Contemplating the theory of time travel, without working with the formulas or other theories. Just let your own thoughts speak!<br>
    <b>Plot Twist:</b> Try not to mention any scientists or scholars associated with any theory related to time travel. All instances of logic presented by you should be a compilation of your own contemplated theories.</p>

<div class="Thread1">
    <h3>#Thread1</h3>
    <div class="Thread1">
        <div class="Original Thread">  <p>Very first, let me dispel the masses' misconceptions about 'time travel.' My observations have revealed that the general perception of time travel often reaches illogical extremes. Masses commonly envision time travel as a scenario where an individual steps into a time machine and is transported to a moment far ahead or far back from the present. However, real-world theories about time travel operate quite differently from these fictional tales.</p>

            <p>Let me define time travel for you, with a few complex scientific logic associated with it, in simple phrases.
            Speed: So speed is the most fundamental factor to consider, or you could even liken it to the atom, if time travel were an object. Not yours, not mine; it's all about the speed of light. Everything related to time travel can be figured out once you consider the speed at which light travels.

            <p><b>How is the speed of light related to time travel?</b><br>
            Basically, everything you see around is due to light's grace. The light rays emitted by a source get reflected off an object, which then enter our eyes and create an image of that object on our retina...(taking it simple) and the object is visible to us. This complete path travelled by light divided by time, is called the speed of light. The sense of every motion/movement in action before you is delivered to your eyes by the light. The moment when light completes its journey from its source to create a picture of the scene before you, followed by sound traveling at a corresponding speed, can be defined as the present moment.</p>

            <p><b>Consider a practical example...</b><br>
            There's an individual before you, playing a drum on an open ground during the daytime. You are acutely aware of every movement he makes, followed by the sound produced with each beat of the drum. The visibility results from the reflection of light off every action performed by the individual and the drum. Similarly, the sound follows the same principle. And the accepted speed of light is one's present moment. However, the speed of sound being relatively lower than the speed of light, this still doesn't create any glitch in the scene.</p>

            <p><b>Now imagine this speed of light being notiecably slower than usual along with a corresponding change in the speed of sound as well.<br> So the change in the scene might occur as follows:</b></p>
            <p>As the reflected light will now consume a longer period of time, with a corresponding delay in the formation of the image of the scene in action, resulting the individual's movement to appear slower than the actual motion.</p>

            <p><b>Ever heard about a phrase, "When we look into the sky we are looking into the past?"</b><br>
            This is practically what I'm trying to convince you with. When you look into the sky, light buckles up for its duty to create an image for your eye of what's happening up there. The bright shining stars up there are incredibly far away from Earth. Which consequently causes light to travel a long distance, reflecting back from these stars and forming their image in your eyes. Even though light is the fastest, it still takes millions of years for the reflected starlight to reach us. So practically the Stars we now see up in the sky are already dead stars from the past. Yes, these stars are those which existed millions of years ago, and what we see is in present is just an image.</p><br>

            <b>You never knew you were already peeping into the past!</b>
            
            <p>So basically, speed of light forms to be a primary factor to be taken into consideration while we discuss to travel ahead or back of the present moment. Now changing out the positions, consider yourself moving faster than the speed of light. Imagine a scenario with yourself at a place looking out to visit another place, where someone's waiting with a cake to be cut by you. The distance between these two locations is 90 kilometers. The location you're visiting has imposed certain conditions; if you don't arrive by 2:05, they will cut the cake right at that time. Right now it's been 2:00, and you have to course a distance of 90 kilometers within 5 minutes, which is practically impossible with your natural speed. Don't bring any vehicles into picture, just keep weaving your imagination plot by plot followed by what you read here:</p> 

            <p><b>#1:</b> In a typical scenario, you failed to reach your destination, experiencing a delay of 3 hours due with your natural speed. And the cake has been cut, while you already knew this thing is going to happen as it was practically not possible for you to course a distance of 90 kilometers within 5 minutes.</p>
            <p><b>#2:</b> In a supernatural scenario, you are determined to reach your destination before 2:05. Your dedication leads to the innovation of a vehicle that surpasses the extraordinarily high natural speed of any existing machine. So, now you are making an attempt to travel 90 kilometers within 5 minutes with a supernatural speed with the help of your innovation.</p>
            <p><b>#3:</b> Consider you left your place sharp at 2:00 with your supernatural vehicle,its been 2:05 and you are already on your destination. So basically you are now in the scene where you weren't supposed to be, naturally.</p>
            <p><b>What actually happened?</b><br>
            For the normal instance, the moment you got to your destination i.e 5:05, whatever happened at 2:05 forms to be a past incident.
            But with the supernatural speed you managed to mark your presence in the past and changed the scene. This is just a gameplay with time.</p>

            <p><b>Now let's fly higher with this concept!</b></p>
            We are already familiar with the logic that the higher you fly, the less time you take to reach your destination. 
            <p><b>Does that mean the time slows down as you move higher?</b></p>
            <p><b>Yes! understand this with an example:</b>
            Consider a space trip sponsered by me for you ...(thank me later).
            So, you are high above the planet Earth on a 3 year package tour. According to the theory we established earlier, as you ascend higher, time progresses more slowly, because even if you remain stationary in space, Earth continues its orbital motion. As you distance yourself further and ascend higher from this motion, time slows down.</p>

            <p>And this slowing of time continues throughout the entire duration you spend in space. In your case, its been 3 years for you in space. However, this time difference isn't very noticeable, so once you return to Earth, you'll find the time here being ahead by a few milliseconds. So, you can now definitely say that you travelled few milliseconds into the future.</p>
<p>And this concept is indeed feasible; in fact, this has already happened when an astronaut spent 900 days in space back then! (maintaining the plot twist without delving into details.)
Now we are ready dive deep into the concept of time travel.</p>


            <p><b>Still not getting goosebumps?</b><br>
            So, let's step into a spacecraft and begin a journey towards a planet located incredibly far from Earthâ€”a voyage that could span millions of years for you to traverse with a natural potential speed of the spacecraft. However, in this scenario, your journey in that direction at the speed of light will take only 5 years of your life to reach there. Remaining stationary in space already puts you slightly behind real time, and traveling far away from Earth at the speed of light will result in you lagging decades behind the real time. 
Now take a note of the initial 5 years spent traveling towards the planet's direction, and then add another 5 years as you make your journey back to Earth. But your 10 years of journey have brought you 50 years ahead of the time on Earth.</p>
            <p><b>Now this is something like stepping right into the realm of time travel!...</b></p>

              <i>All of this has been an overview of the theory of time travel. Just a heads-up, though â€“ we've been focused on the future side of things; I haven't delved into the intricacies of journeying back to the past. Maybe that's a tale for another time! But this is just the beginning. I'm hand this over to you. Go ahead and compile your own theories about time travel, linked to the article down below. Just go on weaving the threads of this concept. Priorly, help me out with my query about
                  what would happen if light travels faster than its natural speed, with reference to the example of the individual with a drum that we considered above.<br> Reach out to me via email at</i><b> aaryan.and.article01@gmail.com</b><i> all your suggestions and queries are welcomed.</i></p>
